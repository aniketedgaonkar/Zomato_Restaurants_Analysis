# Zomato_Restaurants_Analysis ( Data Visualization creation using Python by Python Libraries)
## Project Objective
Zomato wants to analyze their restaurants and orders to understand trends in their orders. So that, they understand which type of restaurants getting good number of orders, ratings of restaurants,etc.
## Dataset used

This project involves data analysis using Python, incorporating fundamental techniques along with key libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
The analysis is based on a CSV file containing Zomato restaurant data. 
By utilizing these tools, I explored and visualized the dataset to uncover valuable insights and meaningful information about restaurant trends and characteristics.

Key Insights from the Analysis:
1.Restaurant Categories: The majority of restaurants are classified under the 'Dining' category.
2.Voting Trends: Dining restaurants receive the highest number of votes for their ratings.
3.Rating Distribution: Most restaurants receive ratings between 3.5/5 and 4.0/5, indicating generally favorable customer feedback.
4.Cost Preferences: Couples tend to prefer ordering from restaurants where the cost for two people is approximately â‚¹300.
5.Order Type Ratings: Restaurants that receive online orders tend to receive higher ratings compared to those with offline orders.
6.Customer Preferences: People likes to go to Dining Restaurants and enjoying meals at restaurants but for cafes people likes to order food online rather than enjoying it in cafes.


Conclusion:- 
From Analysis of the data, I conclude that most of restaurants comes under Dining category and Dining restaurants receving offline orders more than online. So Zomato can give great deals to Dining customers so they can order online ranther than offilne as customers gives good rating to restaurants while ordering food online.
